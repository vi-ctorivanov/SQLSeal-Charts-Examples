This Obsidian vault is an example vault showcasing [my](https://v-os.ca) personal usage of the [SQLSeal](https://github.com/h-sphere/sql-seal) plugin, along with its companion plugin [SQLSeal Charts](https://github.com/h-sphere/sql-seal-charts) (and [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/), by association).

SQLSeal was very appealing to me, because it provided me with the means to query my `.csv` files spanning multiple years of productivity logs and financial data and chart that data in a variety of ways - both for analysis, and for the pure joy of enjoying pretty data visualization.

This vault focuses on precisely that pipeline, and includes:

- A template for productivity tracking - [[Productivity.csv]]
- A template for financial tracking - [[Finances.csv]] + [[Budget.csv]]
- 10 productivity charts - [[Productivity]]
- 4 finance charts - [[Finances]]
- A number of inline queries summarizing tracked data - [[Productivity]] + [[Finances]]
- An example of embedding charts into other files for improved organization - [[Embedding]]

Some charts differ only slightly, and some use advanced mode to handle more unique data formatting requirements. They are all styled in a relatively consistent way that work for my needs specifically, please feel free to play around and make them suit your own tastes and requirements.

I hope you find this example vault helpful!
